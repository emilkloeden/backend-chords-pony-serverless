Phew that's a combobulated mouthful. In short it's an attempt to develop and deploy a set of serverless functions to vercel that could serve as a JSON API - and thus backend of any of the Chords! project frontends.

Written in python, using SQLite as a database engine and PonyORM as an Object Relational Mapper.
